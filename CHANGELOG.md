## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-01

First tagged milestone: complete data foundation — database, storage, networking, and the
end-to-end book ingestion pipeline. No UI yet. **Room schema v1 is frozen as of this
release**; all future schema changes require a version bump plus a tested migration.

### Added

- **Book ingestion pipeline** (`AddBookByIsbnUseCase`): ISBN in, fully persisted book out —
  normalizes/validates ISBN-10/13, fetches metadata, downloads the cover, stores it
  content-addressed, and inserts all rows in one atomic transaction. Cover failures degrade
  gracefully (book saved without cover). (`602006d`)
- `coverImageHash` column on `MediaItemEntity` for content-addressed cover lookup. (`602006d`)
- **Networking layer**: engine-injectable Ktor `HttpClient` factory (lenient JSON, 15s
  timeouts); Open Library client (primary) with failure-tolerant author sub-fetches;
  Google Books client (keyless fallback); provider fallback chain; cover image downloader.
  16 MockEngine tests — no test ever hits the real network. (`06d7b6b`)
- **Repository layer**: sealed `Resource` result wrapper; `BookRepository` with atomic
  `addBook` (`@Transaction` DAO, verified by a forced mid-transaction rollback test) and
  Flow-based reads; `ReadingSessionRepository` with timestamp/duration validation. (`81c0fcb`)
- **Content-addressable image storage** (`LocalImageStorageManager`): SHA-256-hashed
  `<hash>.jpg` files with automatic deduplication; known-vector and corrupt-input tests. (`c314081`)
- **Database foundation**: polymorphic Room KMP schema v1 — `MediaItems` universal table
  with `BookDetails`, `ExternalIdentifiers` (composite key), and `ReadingSessions` child
  tables; UUID string primary keys, FK cascade deletes, Flow-based DAOs, exported schema,
  in-memory DAO test suite. (`5eb8250`)
- **Project foundation**: Kotlin Multiplatform `shared` module (Android + JVM targets)
  wired to the Android app; version catalog with Kotlin 2.2.21, Room KMP 2.8.4, Ktor 3.5.1,
  kotlinx serialization/coroutines/datetime. (`a22d87c`)

### Known issues / tech debt

- AGP 9 workaround: `android.builtInKotlin=false` + `android.newDsl=false` are required
  until KSP supports the new `com.android.kotlin.multiplatform.library` plugin
  (google/ksp#2476); both flags are removed in AGP 10.
- Room-touching tests run only on `:shared:jvmTest` (no Robolectric); the Android
  unit-test variant excludes them by package filter.
- `BookFormat` defaults to `PHYSICAL` on ingestion — ISBN metadata does not reliably
  expose edition format; needs a user-facing correction flow later.
